# Real-Time-Audio-Pitch-Grapher

This is a simple Python application that processes live audio data and plots the estimated pitch in real-time.

What's next for this project?
1) Deploy the basic functionality as a web application
2) Add features such as start/stop buttons and data download
3) Optimize the pitch estimation algorithm for speed and accuracy
